        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "   In Python, a function is an independent block of code that performs a specific task and is defined using the def keyword. It can be called from anywhere in the program and does not belong to any object. Functions can take arguments, process data, and return a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "  A method, on the other hand, is a function that is associated with an object, typically inside a class. Methods operate on the data contained within the object and are called using the object reference. Unlike functions, methods can modify the object's state and often require self as the first parameter to access instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "A parameter is a variable listed in a function's definition that acts as a placeholder for values. When a function is called, arguments are passed to these parameters to provide data for processing. Parameters define what kind of input a function expects.\n",
        "\n",
        " An argument is the actual value passed to a function during a call. It replaces the parameter and allows the function to execute with specific data. Python supports different types of arguments, including positional arguments, keyword arguments, default values, and variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "The most common way to define a function is using the def keyword, followed by a function name and parameters. It is then called using its name and passing required arguments. Python also allows defining functions with default arguments, where parameters have pre-defined values if not provided.\n",
        "\n",
        " Other methods include using *args for variable-length positional arguments and **kwargs for variable-length keyword arguments. Lambda functions provide a concise way to define simple functions in a single line. Additionally, functions can be stored in variables or passed as arguments to other functions for dynamic execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n",
        "The return statement is used in a function to send a value back to the caller. It allows functions to produce an output that can be stored in variables, used in expressions, or passed to other functions. Without return, a function will return None by default.\n",
        "\n",
        " Using return enhances reusability and modularity by allowing functions to compute results and provide meaningful outputs. A function can also return multiple values as a tuple, making it more flexible for handling various data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "An iterable is any Python object that can return its elements one at a time, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. It contains an __iter__() method, which allows it to be looped over using for.\n",
        "\n",
        " An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and is produced by calling iter() on an iterable. It implements both __iter__() and __next__() methods, allowing it to fetch elements one by one. Iterators do not store data in memory but generate it on demand, making them more memory-efficient than iterables.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "A generator is a special type of iterator in Python that is used to generate values lazily using the yield keyword instead of return. Unlike regular functions, generators do not execute completely at once; instead, they produce values one at a time and pause execution at each yield.\n",
        "\n",
        " Generators are defined like normal functions but use yield to return values. When next() is called, the function resumes execution from where it was last paused. This makes generators highly efficient for handling large data streams.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "One major advantage of generators is memory efficiency, as they do not store all values in memory but generate them on demand. This is useful for working with large datasets where storing all values would be inefficient.\n",
        "\n",
        " Generators also improve performance, as they allow lazy evaluation, meaning values are produced only when needed. Additionally, they simplify code readability by eliminating the need for maintaining and updating a state manually, as the function execution automatically resumes from the last yield statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "A lambda function is an anonymous function in Python that is defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only contain a single expression. Lambda functions are mainly used for short, simple operations where defining a full function would be unnecessary.\n",
        "\n",
        " These functions are often used in scenarios like sorting with custom keys, filtering data in lists, or as arguments to functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(). Their compact syntax makes them useful for quick, one-time operations without cluttering the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
        "The map() function applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns an iterator containing the results. It allows processing elements without using explicit loops, making the code cleaner and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        " For example, if we need to square all numbers in a list, we can use map() instead of a for loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n",
        "The map() function applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable containing the results. It is useful for transforming data without modifying the original structure.\n",
        "\n",
        " The filter() function also applies a function to an iterable, but it only returns the elements that satisfy a given condition. It is commonly used for extracting specific elements from a collection based on a condition."
